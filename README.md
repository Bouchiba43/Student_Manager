# Student_Manager

The student management application is a program that allows users to maintain a list of students and perform various operations on it, such as adding, removing, updating, searching, and sorting students. It uses an array or linked list to store the list and provides a main menu for the user to choose which operation to perform. A student is described by their identifier, name, level of study, and overall average.
